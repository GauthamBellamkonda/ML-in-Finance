## Introduction

Machine learning has revolutionized the way we approach financial data analysis and forecasting. By leveraging advanced algorithms, we can uncover hidden patterns, make informed predictions, and gain valuable insights from complex financial datasets. This repository is designed to help you explore and implement machine learning techniques in the realm of finance.

## Implemented Models

Here are some of the key machine learning models implemented in this repository:

### Support Vector Regression (SVR)

SVR is a powerful regression technique that aims to find a hyperplane that best fits the data points. It's particularly useful for predicting continuous values in financial scenarios, such as stock prices or commodity prices. [Code](StockPrediction_SVR.ipynb)

### Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

RNNs are a class of neural networks designed to handle sequential data. In finance, RNNs can be employed to analyze time-series data, making them valuable for tasks like predicting market trends and stock prices. [Code](StockPrediction_RNNs.ipynb)

### Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks

LSTMs are a specialized type of RNN that can capture long-range dependencies in sequential data. In finance, LSTMs are used for tasks like portfolio management, credit risk assessment, and high-frequency trading predictions. [Code](StockPrediction_LSTM.ipynb)

### Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)

ARIMA is a classical time-series forecasting method. It's particularly suitable for predicting future values based on past observations. ARIMA can be applied to financial data to forecast stock prices, exchange rates, and more. [Code](StockPrediction_ARIMA.ipynb)

Each model directory contains the necessary code files and a README explaining the model's theory, application, and how to run the code effectively.
